# Math Game

Welcome to the Math Game project! This is a web-based game designed to test and improve your arithmetic skills through a fun and interactive interface.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is responsible for the user interface and game logic. It consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the game interface, including question display, answer input, submit button, and score display.
- **styles/main.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the game interface, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance.
- **scripts/app.js**: The JavaScript logic that handles generating random math questions, tracking player input, checking answers, updating the score, and managing the timer.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the frontend, including instructions on how to run the game and its features.

### Backend

The backend handles the generation of random math questions and stores game data. It includes:

- **app.py**: The Python backend logic for generating random math questions and storing player scores and question statistics.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the backend, such as Flask or other necessary libraries.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the backend, including setup and running instructions.

## Features

- Randomly generated arithmetic questions.
- Score tracking for players.
- Timer to challenge players.
- Responsive design for various devices.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to play the game.
3. For the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and run `app.py` to start the server.

Enjoy testing your math skills!
